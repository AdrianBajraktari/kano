SwiftKey no longer feels half so swift. There are several threads on their forum filled with users like me who hate the change, and at least want an option to bring back the old way, but the developers seem to have their hearts set on the flawed UI. It's enough of a problem that I can't really recommend SwiftKey as all that big an improvement over the stock keyboard anymore. What's more concerning than the actual change is that the developers don't appear to care whether their users find their product usable. They actually posted in some of the threads that they intentionally made this huge change to basic operation without even mentioning it in the change log to see if anyone noticed. I'm glad that SwiftKey wants to innovate, and a minority of users agreeably seem to prefer this new slowness, so an option to enable it may actually be warranted. I just wish I could could still believe, as I did before this series of updates, that SwiftKey really wanted to be the best and most useful keyboard available.
